# Memory Game

This Memory Matching Game is a fun, short game for children to hone their memory and matching skills, as well as their hand-eye coordination skills (i.e. using a keyboard and mouse/phone/tablet)

They should remember where the previous cards were in order to make pairs that remain turned once completed

## UX

This game is for children, so the colour scheme had to be fun and inviting, as well as the font schemes

I used [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) to find fonts that complemented each other and were also eye-catching, I chose Train One and Source Sans Pro

I also used [Bootstrap 5.0](https://getbootstrap.com/) to provide some basic padding and initial page setup and for assistance with mobile design

### Wireframes

To aid with UX, I created wireframes to plan where the content would go in the finished website.

Using wireframes helps when thinking about user stories and how a user navigates through the website.

I created mock images of what my website would look like, as below:

* Homepage:
![HomeWireframe](/assets/img/readme-img/index wireframe.png)

* Game Page (example is from 'Easy' difficulty):
![EasyWireframe](/assets/img/readme-img/index wireframe.png)

## User stories

The target audience for this webpage is a child, therefore it was imperative that I used an eye-catching colour theme, I used [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) in order to create a palette

I also wanted to include different difficulties in my project to appeal to a wider age/ability range

## Features

### Existing Features
* Header - this is uniform across the site and houses the title/logo which links back to the Homepage (where the difficulty selector is)
* Subheading for difficulty pages - this allows users to see what difficulty they are playing
* Grid item front/back - these are the cards that get matched in order to finish the game

#### Images
Images help to aid the user visually, so they are able to immediately identify the brand image, in this case, images on the Home page will be of glasses displays, and also images on the Team page of team members.

I chose to add borders to my images to bring together the colour scheme.

## Technologies Used 

* [Bootstrap 5.0](https://getbootstrap.com/)
    * The project uses Bootstrap as a framework on which to build the webpage - the grid-based system, using columns and rows, is optimised for use on mobile and desktops so is ideal for continuity across different pages of the same website
* [CSS](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS/)
    * CSS is used to provide styling for both original HTML features and additional styling to Bootstrap
* [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
    * An API that imports fonts that are more visually appealing than a browser's built-in fonts
* [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/)
    * JavaScript is one of the world's most popular programming languages and is used to bring interactivity to web pages to engage users 
* [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)
    * A JavaScript library that is used for document traversal and manipulation, event handling and animation

## Testing

After general spellcheck and housekeeping within GitPod, my initial tests for the webpage were using [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/new/), a common browser with facilities to also view the webpage in mobile resolutions using the developer tools

I extensively tested the card game using Mozilla Firefox and also tested in Google Chrome and Safari.

## Deployment

#### GitHub Pages

I followed the instructions on how to deploy to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) from my GitHub account, which is where my website is currently deployed: [https://ktgreen.github.io/milestone-project-2/](https://ktgreen.github.io/milestone-project-2/)

After navigating to my repository, I clicked 'Settings' and then scrolled down until I found the settings for GitHub Pages. After choosing a source (I chose 'master') within this setting, it then deploys the page with the changes that have been pushed in Git to it's own page.
